abstract={High-temperature copper oxide superconductors consist of stacked CuO2 planes, with electronic band structures and magnetic excitations that are primarily two-dimensional1,2, but with superconducting coherence that is three-dimensional. This dichotomy highlights the importance of out-of-plane charge dynamics, which has been found to be incoherent in the normal state3,4 within the limited range of momenta accessible by optics. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to explore the charge dynamics across all three dimensions of the Brillouin zone. Polarization analysis of recently discovered collective excitations (modes) in electron-doped copper oxides5--7 reveals their charge origin, that is, without mixing with magnetic components5--7. The excitations disperse along both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, revealing its three-dimensional nature. The periodicity of the out-of-plane dispersion corresponds to the distance between neighbouring CuO2 planes rather than to the crystallographic c-axis lattice constant, suggesting that the interplane Coulomb interaction is responsible for the coherent out-of-plane charge dynamics. The observed properties are hallmarks of the long-sought `acoustic plasmon', which is a branch of distinct charge collective modes predicted for layered systems8--12 and argued to play a substantial part in mediating high-temperature superconductivity10--12.},

From the resonant energy dependence and the out-of-plane momentum dependence, the charge excitations are identified as three-dimensional (3D) plasmons, which reflect the nature of the electronic structure and Coulomb repulsion on both short and long lengthscales. With increasing electron doping, the plasmon excitations increase monotonically in energy, a consequence of the electron correlation effect on electron structure near the Fermi surface (FS). Importantly, the plasmon excitations evolve from a broad feature into a well-defined peak with much increased life time, revealing the evolution of the electrons from incoherent states to coherent quasi-particles near the FS. Such evolution marks the reduction of the short-range electronic correlation, and thus the softening of the Mottness of the system with increasing electron doping.},

From a combination of these experimental data the dielectric function, the reflectivity and the optical conductivity have been obtained in a wide energy range. The observed spectra are interpreted in terms of optical phonons, free-carrier absorption, transitions across the charge-transfer gap, further interband transitions, low-lying core-level excitations, excitonic transitions and valence conservingd-d transitions within the Cu 3d shell combined with O 2p intraband transitions. The charge carrier plasmon and the 4 eV-excitation in YBa2Cu3O6 show quadratic dispersions in momentum transfer. From the dispersion constant of the plasmon a mean value of the Fermi velocity of the charge carriers parallel to the CuO2 planes has been derived.},

abstract = {Electron energy-loss spectra of oxide superconductors of La2−xSrxCuO4 (x=0.08, 0.15 and 0.18) and an insulator of La2CuO4 (x=0.0) have been measured from their perfect crystalline areas (180nmφ) over an energy range of 0–60eV. Each spectrum showed two large peaks at about 13 and 30eV. Those peaks were assigned to the interband transition of O 2p→La 5d/4f and the volume plasmon due to the oscillation of all valence electrons, respectively. The loss functions of carrier-doped materials (x=0.08, 0.15 and 0.18) showed a sharp peak at 0.8–0.9eV, which was not observed in the loss function of x=0.0. The dielectric functions of the materials are derived from the loss-functions by Kramers–Kronig analysis. The imaginary part of the dielectric functions showed that two new transition peaks at 1.5 and 2.6eV were formed for x=0.08, 0.15 and 0.18 by Sr-doping. The transitions at 1.5 and 2.6eV were assigned to the transitions from O 2p to the mid-gap state and Cu 3d band, respectively. The peaks observed at 0.8–0.9eV in the loss-functions of x=0.08, 0.15 and 0.18 were assigned not to a free carrier plasmon but to a plasmon strongly coupled with the new interband transition at 1.5eV. Reflectance spectra calculated from the dielectric functions of x=0.08, 0.15 and 0.18 show a steep decrease at about 1eV corresponding to the peak at 0.8–0.9eV in the loss-functions. The reflectance spectra agree well with that of optical measurements. Thus, the so-called plasma edge in reflectance spectra was explained to be formed by the interband transition at 1.5eV.}

Such experiments, also called electron energy-loss spectroscopy, are particularly useful for the investigation of the collective excitations in metals, the charge carrier plasmons. These plasmons are characterized by a specific dispersion (energy–momentum relationship), which contains information on the sometimes complex nature of the conduction electrons in topical materials.

abstract = {The reflection spectra were measured on single crystals of Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 in the region of 30–40 000 cm−1. The dielectric functions were calculated by Kramers-Kronig transformation of the reflection spectra. Analysis by the simple harmonic oscillator model reveals that the plasma frequencies of the Drude band are 6400 cm−1 (Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10) and 6000 cm−1 (Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8). Four and three mid-IR exciton bands were found in Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, respectively. The reflectance edges are found at 10 800 cm−1 and 9500 cm−1 for these crystals. The frequency-dependent scattering rate shows strong interaction of free carriers with the mid-IR excitations. Seven phonon bands were observed on Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 and Bi2Sr2NdCu2O8 crystals, where the sliding modes of the CuO plane have strong intensity due to coupling with the motion of free carriers. The electronic excitation in the visible region is assigned to the transition from the deep O2p level to the hole near the Fermi level. The loss function is calculated by the dielectric function, which is in excellent agreement with EELS result.}

The description of a lattice in terms of conducting bilayers surrounded by a non-conducting medium can be seen as a first approximation to oxide superconductors like Bi2212 and Tl2212. The relevancy of the partial density of states for experimental probes like reflection EELS will be briefly discussed. Preceding the exact description of the partial DOS we will give a short summary of the derivation of the plasmon dispersion in a two layer/unit cell system [A. Griffin, A.J. Pindor, Phys. Rev. B 39 (1989) 11 503] and describe the two different branches that emerge. Finally, the total DOS is calculated numerically and is compared to the one layer/unit cell case.}

@book{Ibach1977,
abstract = {The development of surface physics and surface chemistry as a science is closely related to the technical development of a number of methods involving electrons either as an excitation source or as an emitted particle carrying characteristic information. Many of these various kinds of electron spectroscopies have become commercially available and have made their way into industrial laboratories. Others are still in an early stage, but may become of increasing importance in the future. In this book an assessment of the various merits and possible drawbacks of the most frequently used electron spectroscopies is attempted. Emphasis is put on prac tical examples and experimental design rather than on theoretical considerations. The book addresses itself to the reader who wishes to know which electron spectroscopy or which combination of different electron spectroscopies he may choose for the particular problems under investigation. After a brief introduction the practical design of electron spectrometers and their figures of merit important for the different applications are discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 deals with electron excited electron spectroscopies which are used for the elemental analysis of surfaces. Structure analysis by electron diffrac tion is described in Chapter 4 with special emphasis on the use of electron diffrac tion for the investigation of surface imperfections. For the application of electron diffraction to surface crystallography in general, the reader is referred to Volume 4 of "Topics in Applied Physics".},

The first gives rise to weak EELS continua and consists in Bloch-like interface modes propagating throughout the layered medium.

abstract = {Using a transfer matrix method, we study the properties of the localized plasmon modes in a semi-infinite semiconductor superlattice (SL) with cap layer. The results show that in such a structure there exist three localized plasmon modes. They may appear either in the gap between two bulk plasmon bands, or below and above the bulk plasmon bands. The evolution from the extended plasmon modes to the localized plasmon modes can clearly be tracked with the change of the structural parameters or the relative electron density. A brief analysis of these results is given. It is suggested that the localized plasmon modes can be artificially controlled by adjusting the parameters of the proposed micro-structures.}

abstract={Quantum criticality is associated with a system composed of a nearly infinite number of interacting quantum degrees of freedom at zero temperature, and it implies that the system looks on average the same regardless of the time- and length scale on which it is observed. Electrons on the atomic scale do not exhibit such symmetry, which can only be generated as a collective phenomenon through the interactions between a large number of electrons. In materials with strong electron correlations a quantum phase transition at zero temperature can occur, and a quantum critical state has been predicted1,2, which manifests itself through universal power-law behaviours of the response functions. Candidates have been found both in heavy-fermion systems3 and in the high-transition temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors4, but the reality and the physical nature of such a phase transition are still debated5,6,7. Here we report a universal behaviour that is characteristic of the quantum critical region. We demonstrate that the experimentally measured phase angle agrees precisely with the exponent of the optical conductivity. This points towards a quantum phase transition of an unconventional kind in the high-Tc superconductors.},

abstract = {The crystal structures of the compounds Sr2RuO4 and Sr2IrO4 have been analyzed at room temperature and at 10 K with the neutron powder diffraction technique and the Rietveld method of profile fitting. Sr2RuO4 crystallizes with the symmetry of space group I4/mmm and room temperature lattice parameters a = 3.8730(3) and c = 12.7323(9) Å, while Sr2IrO4 has the symmetry of space group I 41/acd and lattice parameters a = 5.4994(1) and c = 25.7841(8) Å. The unit cells of the two compounds are related to one another by the transformation matrix (1, -1, 0/1, 1, 0/0, 0, 2). The main difference between the two structures is that the MO6 octahedra (M = Ru, Ir) have a regular, undistorted configuration in the ruthenium compound, while they are tilted by about 11° around the c axis of the unit cell in the iridium compound. The oxygen atoms of the IrO2 layers were found to be disordered over two sets of positions x , x, 14 with x = 14 ± δ. This means that the IrO6 octahedra assume two configurations and on a local level their relative orientation does not obey the symmetry requirements of space group I41/acd in all cases. The M O6 octahedra are elongated along the c axis, and this distortion is more pronounced in Sr2RuO4 than in Sr2IrO4. The coordination of the strontium atoms is ninefold in both compounds. Because of the tilting of the IrO6 octahedra, however, the coordination polyhedra are different in the two cases. No phase transitions have been observed down to 10 K in either compound.}

In addition, the absolute spectral weight of an optical spectrum reveals optical sum-rules, which are one of the most powerful tools of experimental and theoretical physics providing access to deeply rooted quantities such as the effective mass of the charge carriers and their kinetic energy. The formalism for the optical conductivity of correlated electrons is presented in this chapter for general values of the inverse wavelength {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}and general band dispersion {\$}{\$}{\backslash}epsilon {\_}k{\$}{\$}of the electrons. The corresponding sumrule is found to have a characteristic {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}-dependence for the nearest-neighbour tight binding model, causing in this case a vanishing of spectral weight for {\$}{\$}q{\$}{\$}at the Brillouin-zone boundary, i.e. for {\$}{\$}qa={\backslash}pi {\$}{\$}. These findings are of possible importance for {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}-resolved infrared spectroscopy, a technique which is in full development at the moment.",

The spectra of the noble metals are complex and show few similarities to one another.

abstract = {The first, second, and third editions of this book seem to occur at ten year intervals. The intent is to keep the book up-to-date. Many-body theory is a field which continually evolves in time. Journals only publish new results, conferences only invite speakers to report new phenomena, and agencies only fund scientists to do new physics. Today's physics is old hat by tomorrow. Students want to learn new material, and textbooks must be modified to keep up with the times. The early chapters in this book teach the techniques of many-body theory. They are largely unchanged in format. The later chapters apply the techniques to specific problems. The third edition increases the number of applications. New sections have been added, while old sections have been modified to include recent applications. The previous editions were set in type using pre-computer technology. No computer file existed of the prior editions. The publisher scanned the second edition and gave me a disk with the contents. This scan recorded the words accurately and scrambled the equations into unintelligible form. So I retyped the equations using LaTeX. Although tedious, it allowed me to correct the infinite numbers of typographical errors in the previous edition. The earlier typesetting methods did not permit such corrections. The entire book was edited sentence-by­ sentence. Most old sections of the book were shortened by editing sentences and paragraphs.},

Starting with an operator-based introduction to the quantum field theory of many-body physics, this textbook presents the Feynman diagram approach, Green's functions and finite-temperature many-body physics before developing the path integral approach to interacting systems. Special chapters are devoted to the concepts of Fermi liquid theory, broken symmetry, conduction in disordered systems, superconductivity and the physics of local-moment metals. A strong emphasis on concepts and numerous exercises make this an invaluable course book for graduate students in condensed matter physics. It will also interest students in nuclear, atomic and particle physics.},

This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.}

The energy loss spectrum is compared with that computed from optical data by means of the dielectric theory and shows good agreement. Also the dependance of the surface loss from the scattering angle and the angle of incidence is in agreement with calculated values.

abstract = {Within the last 30 years, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) has become a standard analytical technique used in the transmission electron microscope to extract chemical and structural information down to the atomic level.  In two previous editions, Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy in the Electron Microscope has become the standard reference guide to the instrumentation, physics and procedures involved, and the kind of results obtainable. Within the last few years, the commercial availability of lens-aberration correctors and electron-beam monochromators has further increased the spatial and energy resolution of EELS. This thoroughly updated and revised Third Edition incorporates these new developments, as well as advances in electron-scattering theory, spectral and image processing, and recent applications in fields such as nanotechnology. The appendices now contain a listing of inelastic mean free paths and a description of more than 20 MATLAB programs for calculating EELS data. Considered the "Bible of EELS" Presents the only in-depth, single-author text for the still-expanding field of TEM-EELS Responds to many requests for the first new edition of this classic work since 1996 Includes discussion of new spectrometer and detector designs, together with spectral-analysis techniques such as Bayesian deconvolution and multivariate statistical analysis Provides extended discussion of anisotropic materials, retardation effects, delocalization of inelastic scattering, and the simulation of energy-loss fine structure. Describes recent applications of EELS to fields such as nanotechnology, electronic devices and carbon-based materials. Offers extended coverage of radiation damage and delocalization as limits to spatial resolution.

There is now growing interest in applying such methods to very low energy excitations, such as lattice vibrations, but in this limit the cross section is no longer proportional to a propagator. Significant deviations occur due to the finite temperature Bose statistics of the excitations. Here we consider this issue in the context of high-resolution electron energy-loss experiments on the copper-oxide superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. We find that simple division of a Bose factor yields an accurate propagator on energy scales greater than the resolution width. However, at low energy scales, the effects of resolution and finite temperature conspire to create anomalies in the dynamics at long times. We compare two practical ways for dealing with such anomalies, and discuss the range of validity of the technique in light of this comparison.}

We also examine in a manner more general than earlier discussions the contribution to the small angle scattering cross section from scattering by electric field fluctuations. After certain assumptions are introduced, we find that this contribution to the cross section is proportional to Im [1 + ϵ(Ω)]−1, where ϵ(Ω) is the frequency dependent dielectric constant of the material. We also exhibit an expression for the cross section for scattering from electric field fluctuations set up by particle—hole excitations.}

For analysis, the materials are grouped under one of the headings: element, inorganic compound, organic compound and adsorbed gas, with the path lengths each time expressed in nanometers, monolayers and milligrams per square metre. The path lengths are vary high at low energies, fall to 0.1–0.8 nm for energies in the range 30–100 eV and then rise again as the energy increases further. For elements and inorganic compounds the scatter about a ‘universal curve’ is least when the path lengths are expressed in monolayers, λm. Analysis of the inter-element and inter-compound effects shows that λm is related to atom size and the most accuratae relations are λm = 538E−2+0.41(aE)1/2 for elements and λm=2170E−2+0.72(aE)1/2 for inorganic compounds, where a is the monolayer thickness (nm) and E is the electron energy above the Fermi level in eV. For organic compounds λd=49E−2+0.11E1/2 mgm−2. Published general theoretical predictions for λ, valid above 150 eV, do not show as good correlations with the experimental data as the above relations.},

We discuss advances in this field, dealing in particular with multilayer systems fabricated from metals and/or semiconductors. After reviewing previous work on thin films, we describe results obtained using transfer-matrix methods for the bulk and surface plasmon-polaritons in two-component (or binary) superlattices formed from a periodic array of alternating layers of two different materials. Generalizations to more complex structures are then given, including n-i-p-i semiconductor superlattices, Fibonacci-like superlattices, and superlattices in which some of the layers are piezoelectric materials. Magnetic-field effects are also discussed in terms of magnetoplasmon-polaritons in superlattices. A discussion is given of some of the spectroscopic techniques applicable to plasmon-polaritons in multilayer systems, where we emphasize Raman scattering and far-infrared attenuated total reflection. Finally, some nonlinear effects involving surface plasmon-polaritons are described.}

@book{Powell2010,
abstract = {This book demonstrates the importance of symmetry in determining the properties of solids and the power of using group theory and tensor algebra to elucidate these properties. It provides the fundamentals necessary for the reader to understand how to utilize these techniques in many different applications without becoming lost in a heavy formal treatment of the subject matter. The book begins by discussing the concepts of symmetry relevant to crystal structures. This is followed by a summary of the basics of group theory and how it applies to quantum mechanics. Next is a discussion of the description of the macroscopic properties of crystals by tensors and how symmetry determines the form of these tensors. The basic concepts covered in these early chapters are then applied to a series of different examples including crystal field theory treatment of point defects in solids, molecular orbitals, two-photon processes, the optical properties of solids, the nonlinear optical properties of solids, lattice vibrations, the Jahn-Teller effect, and the effects of translational symmetry on electronic energy bands in solids.. Emphasis is placed on showing how group theory and tensor algebra can provide important information about the properties of a system without resorting to first principal quantum mechanical calculations. The book also features a comprehensive set of relevant tables, including crystal symmetries, point group character tables, matter tensors of different rank, and other tensor properties. Key Features: •Serves as a textbook or reference book for solid-state physics, solid-state chemistry, and materials science and engineering •Shows how the physical properties of solids are determined by their symmetry •Demonstrates the applications of group theory •Utilizes the concept of matter tensors •Includes an extensive set of reference tables and end of chapter problems.},

abstract = {This book emphasises both experimental and theoretical aspects of surface, interface and thin-film physics. As in previous editions the preparation of surfaces and thin films, their atomic and morphological structure, their vibronic and electronic properties as well as fundamentals of adsorption are treated. Because of their importance in modern information technology and nanostructure research, particular emphasis is paid to electronic surface and interface states, semiconductor space charge layers and heterostructures. A special chapter of the book is devoted to collective phenomena at interfaces and in thin films such as superconductivity and magnetism. The latter topic includes the meanwhile important issues giant magnetoresistance and spin-transfer torque mechanism, both effects being of high interest in information technology. In this new edition, for the first time, the effect of spin-orbit coupling on surface states is treated. In this context the class of the recently detected topological insulators, materials of significant importance for spin electronics, are discussed. Particular emphasis, hereby, is laid on the new type of topologically protected surface states with well-defined spin orientation. Furthermore, some important well established experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and reflection anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS), which were missing so far in earlier editions, were added in this new 6th edition of the book.},

The LEG is a model of a metal where the electrical current is carried in parallel layers, and there is no current between layers.

We calculate the image potential from an external charge, the van der Waals potential from a neutral atom and the Casimir force between the parallel surfaces of two LEGs. Our theory does not use dielectric functions. We write down the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, calculate the exact ground state energy and deduce the forces from the energy.

  abstract  = {"Quantum field theory is the mathematical and conceptual framework that describes the physics of the very small, including subatomic particles and quasiparticles. It is used to address a range of problems across subfields, from high-energy physics and gravitation to statistical physics and condensed matter physics. Despite the breadth of its applications, however, the teaching of quantum field theory has historically been strongly oriented toward high-energy physics students, while others-particularly in condensed matter and statistical physics-are typically taught in a separate course, or take an alternate sequence in many-body and statistical physics. Author Eduardo Fradkin strongly believes that this separation is both artificial and detrimental to all groups' understanding of quantum field theory. This textbook, developed from a graduate course Fradkin has taught for decades at the University of Illinois, offers a new, "multicultural" approach to the subject that seeks to remedy this fragmentation. It covers both basic techniques and topics at the frontiers of current research, and integrates modern concepts and examples from high-energy, statistical, and condensed-matter physics alike. Extensive problem sets further illustrate applications across a range of subfields. The book will be suitable for students across physical subdisciplines who have mastered graduate-level quantum mechanics, and will be a useful reference for researchers"-- Provided by publisher.},

The book begins with a self-contained review of ground-state DFT, followed by a detailed and pedagogical treatment of the formal framework of TDDFT. It is explained how excitation energies can be calculated from linear-response TDDFT. Among the more advanced topics are time-dependent current-density-functional theory, orbital functionals, and many-body theory.

The determination of the eigenvalues is equivalent to the diagonalization of a real tridiagonal symmetric u-Toeplitz matrix with (cyclic boundaries) or without (fixed boundaries) perturbed upper right and lower left corners. We solve the TB equations via the Transfer Matrix Method, producing analytical solutions and recursive relations for its eigenvalues, closely related to the Chebyshev polynomials. We examine the density of states and provide relevant analytical relations. We attach semi-infinite leads, determine and discuss the transmission coefficient at zero bias and investigate the peaks number and position, and the effect of the coupling strength and asymmetry as well as of the lead properties on the transmission profiles. We introduce a generic optimal coupling condition and demonstrate its physical meaning.}

We here use the quantized hydrodynamic model of the bounded electron gas to derive an explicit expression for the probability of bulk plasmon excitation by external charged particles moving parallel to the surface. Our results indicate that for each q (the surface plasmon wave vector) there exists a continuum of bulk plasmon excitations, which we also observe within the semi-classical infinite-barrier (SCIB) model of the surface.}

Here we deploy machine learning techniques developed in particle physics to realise a model-independent, multidimensional determination of the ZLP with a faithful uncertainty estimate. This novel method is then applied to subtract the ZLP for EEL spectra acquired in flower-like WS2 nanostructures characterised by a 2H/3R mixed polytypism. From the resulting subtracted spectra we determine the nature and value of the bandgap of polytypic WS2, finding EBG=1.6−0.2+0.3eV with a clear preference for an indirect bandgap. Further, we demonstrate how this method enables us to robustly identify excitonic transitions down to very small energy losses. Our approach has been implemented and made available in an open source Python package dubbed EELSfitter.}

abstract = {Many-body aspects of screening and relaxation mechanisms encountered in spectroscopic studies of the electronic structure of adsorbates have recently attracted considerable attention from both experimental and theoretical physicists. Interest in these phenomena has also been augmented by the rapid improvement of experimental techniques which have enabled better resolution and analysis of various subtile components of the adsorbate spectra. Many of these spectral features have until recently been ascribed to purely chemical and initial state effects. One of the first major advances of the theoretical development in this field was to seek and attribute the origin of these structures to the many-body properties of adsorption systems and, secondly, to predict how the many-body effects would manifest themselves in surface spectroscopies. We start with a rather detailed description of the formalism of the surface electronic response and discuss the properties of the surface excitation spectrum of idealized and real metals. This formalism is then successively applied to set up a model of screening firstly in the nonbonding levels of mainly physisorbed adsorbates and later in the core and valence levels of chemisorbed species. Various modifications of the model enable a dynamic description of the final state relaxation and shake-up effects typical of spectroscopic measurements. To treat the particularly complicated problem of dynamic relaxation in the adsorbate valence levels a special perturbational approach based on Mayer's cluster expansion is developed in §5. The characteristics, and some limitations of this approach, which may also prove useful in other physical problems, are described in detail and discussed within the context of the interaction of localized adsorbate charge fluctuations with bosonic surface excitations. Experimental support for the presented theoretical framework and its applications has been very important. A qualitative comparison with the experimental findings has been given for the majority of effects predicted and some still existing controversies and interpretational problems have been pointed out.}

In the face of ever-more-powerful exclusions and null results from large-exposure searches for TeV-scale DM interacting with nuclei, a significant amount of attention has shifted to lighter (sub-GeV) DM candidates. Direct detection of the light DM in our galaxy by observing DM scattering off a target system requires new approaches compared to prior searches. Lighter DM particles have less available kinetic energy, and achieving a kinematic match between DM and the target mandates the proper treatment of collective excitations in condensed matter systems, such as charged quasiparticles or phonons. In this context, the condensed matter physics of the target material is crucial, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach. In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction to direct detection of keV-GeV DM with condensed matter systems. We give a brief survey of DM models and basics of condensed matter, while the bulk of the review deals with the theoretical treatment of DM-nucleon and DM-electron interactions. We also review recent experimental developments in detector technology, and conclude with an outlook for the field of sub-GeV DM detection over the next decade.}

  abstract = {The spin susceptibility of an exchange enhanced metallic film is studied with the objective of determining how the paramagnetic properties are modified by the surfaces and the finite size of the system. In contrast to the usual treatments, an exchange interaction of finite range λ, comparable to the Fermi wavelength λF, is used. The exchange interactions are taken into account within a mean field theory approximation.The spin susceptibility is explicitly evaluated for a model in which the boundaries are treated as infinitely high potential barriers. It is found that the results depend sensitively on the value of λ. In particular, the large quantum oscillations in the surface magnetization found by earlier workers are significantly reduced in magnitude when a realistic value of the range is used. A generalized Stoner criterion determining the ferromagnetic instability in a film of thickness L is also derived from the spin susceptibility. The critical temperature TcF for a film is found to be depressed below the bulk value TcB for two physically distinct reasons. The first is referred to as a density-of-states effect and gives a depression proportional to L−1; in the absence of density-of-states effects the shift is proportional to L−2.},

At higher energies, inelastic electron scattering or electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in transmission has been the classical method for investigating the collective excitations of electrons, that is, plasmons. The method has been further improved during the years to provide information on interband transitions between valence bands and conduction bands and on core-level excitations to learn about the unoccupied density-of-states and on the lattice structure. This chapter reviews EELS studies using a dedicated electron energy-loss spectrometer. It introduces theory of EELS and describes the Karlsruhe spectrometer. The chapter also describes work on nearly-free-electron metals, rare gas bubbles in metals, amorphous carbon, conducting polymers, and superconductors. It provides an illustration of the present state of the technique applied to solid-state physics and to material science. One of the serious problems in the application of EELS to solid-state physics and material science is the preparation of the samples. While in some cases preparation can be done easily, preparation in other cases is extremely difficult or not feasible at all.},

This chapter covers model and electronic structure approaches to dynamic dielectric screening and discusses the development of the field from the pioneering works by R.H. Ritchie and P. Feibelman up to recent ab-initio developments. Starting with the quantum-mechanical expression for the microscopic dielectric response (Sect. 17.1), we explain the emergence of surface plasmon modes and discuss their structure based on simplified model systems. We further introduce an ab-initio approach to calculate the response function for realistic systems. We discuss how the excitations manifest themselves in the inelastic scattering of electrons reflected from a solid surface or a Q2``$\null$ D crystal (Sect. 17.2), at first confining ourselves to the conventional formalism of energy-loss functions. We then demonstrate the necessity to go beyond this formalism and present the theory of the inelastic scattering of electrons, which takes into account the effect of the kinematics of the probing particle on the excitation process (Sect. 17.3). Finally, we show how the nonlocal response to the incident light leads to a strong enhancement of the microscopic electric field at the surface and how the total exciting field can be included into an ab-initio one-step photoemission theory to describe photoyield enhancement (Sects. 17.6 and 17.7).},

  abstract = {A review is given of recent work on the screening response of the conduction electrons at a simple metal surface. Particular emphasis is placed on the density response function at wave vector transfers typical of electronic excitations involved in, e.g., coupling to an adsorbate. This means that q|| (the wave vector transfer parallel to the surface) can range from a small fraction of kF to q|| &gt; kF, where kF is the Fermi wave vector. This necessitates an entirely microscopic description of the screening process. The solution of the self-consistent problem for the ground state is considered first (for the jellium model). The response problem is then addressed within self-consistent field response theory. The physical model used in the evaluation of the effective potential in the ground state determines the dynamical model for the response function. Several response theories are discussed in unison according to the procedure used to introduce (or entirely drop, as in the case of the random-phase approximation) the many-body effects of exchange and correlation. Applications to dynamic and static screening processes are considered. Examples of dynamical processes are the damping of a vibration of an adsorbed molecule due to decay into electron-hole pairs, and the excitation of collective modes in an atomically-thin overlayer of alkali-metal atoms adsorbed on a metal surface. In the static limit, recent work on lattice relaxation at Al(110) is discussed. In each case contact is made with the relevant experimental evidence.},

  abstract = {We present detailed numerical results for the energy of interaction between a static charge and a jellium surface and for the total energy of interaction between two static charges placed in the surface region. In the latter case we obtain some novel results showing the disappearance of the bulk oscillatory behavior in the total interaction energy as the two charges are brought from inside the metal surface and placed outside the jellium edge. Both response calculations are performed by first computing the static electron density response function in the random-phase approximation. The response function for non-interacting electrons is obtained on the basis of a computa- tional method that renders the eigenfunctions (psi)(,(nu)) ((')x) of the Kohn-Sham equations of a jellium slab in semi-analytical form. This method consists of expanding the dependence of (psi)(,(nu)) ((')x) on the coordinate normal to the jellium surfaces in a sine series and solving a nonlinear matrix version of the Kohn-Sham self-consistent problem. We then investigate the spectrum of elementary excitations of the conduction electrons associated with an overlayer of sodium atoms adsorbed on a metal surface. We compute the surface loss function for the small-angle back-scattering of electrons as function of cover- age (up to two full monolayers of sodium atoms are considered). The ground-state problem is dealt with using Lang's uniform-background model of alkali chemisorption. The dynamical response of the elec- tron gas is treated in the random-phase approximation. Previous theoretical work has, for the most part, assumed that an overlayer of atomic thickness responds as bulk matter. Our microscopic cal- culation reveals that for one-monolayer coverage the overlayer's response in fact deviates significantly from bulk-like behavior. For two-monolayer coverage the response is bulk-like, with a prominent collective (plasmon) mode. The quantum mechanical nature of the overlayer response is displayed in detail. We have also studied the dynamics of atom motion at metal (100) surfaces. The interactions between atoms are modelled with central forces and angle bending forces. Results for frequencies and polari- zations of surface modes are presented for the following metals: body centered Cr, Fe, K, Mo, Na, V, W; face centered Ag, Al, Au, Cu, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh.},

However, polarization sensitivity within such a photodetector remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a broadband photodetector using a layered black phosphorus transistor that is polarization-sensitive over a bandwidth from ∼400 nm to 3,750 nm. The polarization sensitivity is due to the strong intrinsic linear dichroism, which arises from the in-plane optical anisotropy of this material. In this transistor geometry, a perpendicular built-in electric field induced by gating can spatially separate the photogenerated electrons and holes in the channel, effectively reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing the performance for linear dichroism photodetection. The use of anisotropic layered black phosphorus in polarization-sensitive photodetection might provide new functionalities in novel optical and optoelectronic device applications.},

In order to discriminate collective (plasmons) and single-particle (inter band transitions) excitations, we investigate the energy-loss distribution of P 1s photoelectrons in hard X-ray photoelectron spectra of BPh over a wide energy range. The energy-loss function (ELF), averaged over the principal directions of the BPh crystal, has been retrieved by using a Fourier Transform analysis to eliminate multiple inelastic scattering events. At low loss energies (1–8 eV), weak unresolved energy loss peaks are well described by DFT calculated inter band transitions, showing some anisotropy in the dielectric function ε(ω,q) tensor of BPh. At high loss energies, the ELF is dominated by the collective excitation of valence electrons with a peak energy at 20.1 ± 0.2 eV, and weak anisotropy is found in the DFT calculated Im(-1/ε) tensor. The anomalously small peak energy (9.0 ± 0.5 eV) of a weak surface plasmon resonance is attributed either to low surface electron density in the terminal phosphorene layer or to some anisotropic surface plasmon propagation.}

abstract  ="By means of momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) coupled with scanning transmission electron microscopy{,} we have studied the dispersion relation of interband plasmonic modes in the ultraviolet in black phosphorus. We find that the dispersion of the interband plasmons is anisotropic. Experimental results are reproduced by density functional theory{,} by taking into account both the anisotropy of the single-particle response function{,} arising from the anisotropic band structure{,} and the damping. Moreover{,} our theoretical model also indicates the presence of low-energy excitations in the near-infrared that are selectively active in the armchair direction{,} whose existence has been experimentally validated by high-resolution EELS (HREELS) in reflection mode."}

abstract = {From the publisher. Convex optimization problems arise frequently in many different fields. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the subject, and shows in detail how such problems can be solved numerically with great efficiency. The book begins with the basic elements of convex sets and functions, and then describes various classes of convex optimization problems. Duality and approximation techniques are then covered, as are statistical estimation techniques. Various geometrical problems are then presented, and there is detailed discussion of unconstrained and constrained minimization problems, and interior-point methods. The focus of the book is on recognizing convex optimization problems and then finding the most appropriate technique for solving them. It contains many worked examples and homework exercises and will appeal to students, researchers and practitioners in fields such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, finance, and economics.},
