\section{The transfer matrix formalism}

The superlattice in Fig. \ref{figure: superlattice geometry} is made up of layered, 2D conducting planes.  We can define this system through the inter-layer spacing $a$, the background dielectric constant $\e$, and the planar conductivity $\sigma(\qp,\omega)$ along each plane.  This model of the superlattice is a purely electromagnetic system whose geometry is amenable to a {\it transfer matrix} analysis.  My subsequent description of the transfer matrix method leans heavily on Albuquerque and Cottam's analyses of superlattices \cite{Cottam1993,Cottam2004}.\footnote{The most pertinent formalism relevant to Fig. \ref{figure: superlattice geometry} is mostly summarized in section 3.1 of my thesis \cite{Boyd2021}.}  I will depart from these works by ascribing additional physical relevance to the unimodularity of the transfer matrix and by studying the response of the perturbed superlattice, rather than focusing only on its resonant modes.
